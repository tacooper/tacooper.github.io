# Carbon

“Sam, I’ve been giving you a hard time.”

*The attending sucks fifty cubic centimeters of fat out of the patient’s hindquarters through a foot-long liposuction needle and dumps it into a metal strainer.*

“But you’re responding well. You’re proving yourself trainable.”

*The goopier parts of the fat stay trapped in the strainer. The rest of it drains as a pink liquid into a sterile plastic bucket.*

“Sam. Let me ask you a question.”

*I stir what’s left of the fat with a spoon. It’s like something you would find in a kitchen drawer. You’d think it would be fancier.*

“How are diamonds made, Sam?”

*I place the spoon deep inside the pile of sludge and scoop out a glob from the bottom.*

“Carbon, sir. Under enormous pressure.”

“And heat, Sam! Don’t forget heat.”

*I don’t. My hands shake as I spoon the strained fat into a row of syringes. I spill some of it.*

“Now Sam. Tell me! What elements are humans made of?”

*My gloves are covered in God-knows-what.*

“Several, sir. Hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur…”

*The liposuction needle recoils. He’s burrowing through a particularly dense chunk of tissue. I’m taking too long.*

“But what’s the main one, Sam? Which one am I looking for over here?”

*Shit. It’s obvious.*

“Carbon, sir.”

“That is correct! Humans are hunks of carbon. Now Sam, ask yourself. What is the most worthless form carbon can take?”

*He empties more yellow fat into the strainer. It sweats more pink liquid into the waste-bucket. I’m terrible at these read-my-mind questions.*

“Worthless? In what context, sir?”

*He puts down the liposuction needle. Some blood oozes out of the punctured skin. He reflexively wipes it down with sterile gauze.*

“Dirt, Sam. The answer is dirt.” He extends his hand. “Syringe.”

*I pass him the processed semi-liquid fat. He injects it into the patient’s breast. The graft will eventually lose half of its volume under the heat and pressure.*

“So Sam, my little piece of carbon, which will you be? Are you diamond or dirt?”

*I don’t know. I want to be brilliant, but I’ve never heard of anything that grows out of a diamond.*

He winks. “I know what you will choose, Sam.”

*I hand him another package of golden, gooey tissue. He makes it disappear.*

“I know what you will choose.”
